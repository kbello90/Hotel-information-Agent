## 1️⃣ Project & Resource Setup

**Goal:** Clean environment separation, secure data access, predictable deployments.

### Environments
- Create **separate environments**:
  - `dev`
  - `staging`
  - `prod`

- Azure OpenAI (Models)
- Azure AI Search (optional, for RAG)
- Azure Storage (Blobs / Files)
- Azure Key Vault (secrets)
- Azure Monitor / Application Insights (telemetry)

### Networking (if sensitive data exists)
- Private Endpoints + VNET integration
- IP allowlists for admin tools
- Egress rules for outbound calls

### RBAC
- **Least privilege only**
  - Owner / Contributor → platform operators
  - Reader → stakeholders
  - Custom roles → evaluators / annotators

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode keys
- Store API keys & connection strings in **Azure Key Vault**
- Reference secrets via **Foundry connections**
